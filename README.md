# Income Classification Project

This repository contains a machine learning project focused on income classification using the Random Forest algorithm. The goal of this project is to accurately predict the income level of individuals based on various demographic and socio-economic features. We have performed extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA), handled null values, standardized the data, and achieved an accuracy of 93% on the test set using the Random Forest classifier.

## Project Overview

Income classification is a crucial task with numerous applications, such as credit risk assessment, targeted marketing, and social policy planning. In this project, we aim to build a robust classifier that can predict whether an individual's income exceeds a certain threshold. By leveraging the Random Forest algorithm, we can capture complex relationships in the data and make accurate predictions.

## Dataset

The project utilizes a comprehensive dataset containing information about individuals, such as age, education, occupation, marital status, and more. The dataset also includes the corresponding income labels, indicating whether an individual's income is above or below a specific threshold. We have performed data preprocessing steps, including handling missing values and encoding categorical variables, to prepare the data for the machine learning models.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA is a crucial step in understanding the underlying patterns and relationships within the dataset. In this project, we have conducted thorough EDA to gain insights into the data distribution, identify correlations between variables, and detect any outliers or anomalies. Visualizations and statistical analysis have been employed to explore the data and make informed decisions during preprocessing and modeling.

## Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing is essential to ensure the quality and compatibility of the data for machine learning algorithms. In this project, we have handled missing values using appropriate techniques such as imputation or elimination. Additionally, categorical variables have been encoded using methods like one-hot encoding or label encoding. Furthermore, we standardized the numerical features to bring them to a similar scale, which aids in model training and convergence.

## Random Forest Classifier

The Random Forest algorithm is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to make predictions. It is particularly effective in handling complex data and capturing non-linear relationships. In this project, we utilized the Random Forest classifier to predict the income level of individuals based on the available features. The algorithm was trained using the preprocessed data and evaluated on a separate test set.

## Model Evaluation

To assess the performance of the trained Random Forest classifier, we employed various evaluation metrics. The primary metric used is accuracy, which measures the percentage of correctly classified instances. Additionally, we considered other metrics such as precision, recall, and F1 score to evaluate the model's performance across different income categories. Grid search cross-validation (CV) was performed to fine-tune the hyperparameters of the Random Forest algorithm and optimize the model's accuracy.

## Results

After extensive data preprocessing, model training, and hyperparameter tuning, our Random Forest classifier achieved an impressive accuracy of 93% on the test set. The model demonstrates the ability to predict income levels with high precision and recall. These results indicate the effectiveness of the Random Forest algorithm in income classification tasks and its potential for real-world applications.
